# latexindent can be called to act on a file without using the file's extension,
# e.g, simply
#       latexindent myfile
# in which case the choice of file extension is chosen
# according to the choices made in fileExtensionPreference
# Other file extensions can be added.
fileExtensionPreference:
  .ltx: 1
  .bib: 2

# default file extension of backup file (if -w switch is active)
# for example, if your .tex file is called
#       myfile.tex
# and you specify the backupExtension as BACKUP.bak then your
# backup file will be
#       myfileBACKUP.bak
backupExtension: .latexindent-bak

# default value of indentation
defaultIndent: "  "

# if you have indent rules for particular code blocks
# then you can populate them in indentRules; for example, you might just want
# to use a space " " or maybe a double tab "\t\t"
indentRules:
  chapter: ""
  section: "  "
  item: "      "
